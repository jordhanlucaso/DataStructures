# DataStructure Project

## Intro

This project was create to learn and practice data structures with Javascript lenguange, I'm doing this project for personal learnig but could be interesting to work on it to help the community to learn data structures and how to how with them and solve some commun problems.

## Vision

This project will focus on learning data structure. It will try to use the less posible teory and teach everything needed throughout the practice.

## Node Class

I defined a basic node class to represent node on any data structure this could change over time but until I develop a more complex project it will stay like this.
